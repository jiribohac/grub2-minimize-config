# grub2-minimize-config
Replace the config-generating scripts to generate a minimalist grub2 config

Installs alternate scripts in /etc/grub.d 

*This is intended for people who know how to configure their bootloader,
and want to customize the configuration*

The default configuration, generated by the scripts shipped with grub in /etc/grub.d,
is very generic and very complicated. It hurts to modify it by hand or use
the resulting menu on a laggy serial console.
