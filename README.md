# grub2-minimize-config
Replace the config-generating scripts to generate a minimalist grub2 config

Installs alternate scripts in /etc/grub.d 

*This is intended for people who know how to configure their bootloader,
and want to customize the configuration*

The default configuration, generated by the scripts shipped with grub in /etc/grub.d,
is very generic and very complicated. It hurts to modify it by hand or use
the resulting menu on a laggy serial console.

If you're afraid of running such a script, here is a description what the
script does, so you can do it by hand:

- create a directory /etc/grub.d/orig
- move everything (except README) in /etc/grub.d to /etc/grub.d/orig
- install these new files in /etc/grub.d:
  00\_header (generates the beginning of the grub.cfg)
  10\_linux  (generates menu entries for linux kernels)
  40\_custom (an example showing how to create additional menu entries)
- install a new /etc/default/grub
